# 📘 Mini Project 8 – R Programming

This project is a collection of small but powerful R programs that show how to create, clean, and analyze data.

Using randomly generated datasets, it covers tasks like handling missing values, running basic statistical tests, and creating simple visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots.

The goal is to practice key R skills that are useful in data science, such as:
- Creating random data
- Replacing and filling missing values
- Normalizing data
- Finding correlations between columns
- Running t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
- Plotting data to find patterns
